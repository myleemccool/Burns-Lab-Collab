# 🧬 Microbiome Kit Comparison

This repository contains analysis scripts and data for evaluating the **precision and robustness** of different microbiome testing kits using **alpha** and **beta diversity** metrics.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Assess how well each microbiome testing kit replicates known community profiles by examining:

- **Alpha diversity**: How consistent are diversity metrics across replicates?
- **Beta diversity**: How similar are microbial communities across replicates?

---

## 🧪 Experimental Design

Each kit includes:
- 1 **Blank**
- 1 **Mock community**
- 4 **Experimental samples**

---

## 🔍 Analytical Goals

### ✅ Alpha Diversity
- Assess **within-kit precision** using metrics like Shannon diversity and observed richness.
- High spread among replicates indicates low precision.

### ✅ Beta Diversity
- Assess **replicate consistency** within each kit using distance-based methods (e.g., Bray-Curtis).
- Visualize community similarity using PCoA.
- **Blanks should be removed** before analysis.
- Optionally apply a **pseudocount** to avoid zero issues.

---

## 📦 Phyloseq Workflow

1. **Create a `phyloseq` object** that includes all kits and sample types.
2. Subset samples by type: blank, mock, and experimental.
3. **Keep only the `phyloseq` object** in the R workspace before saving.
4. **Save the session** and push to GitHub for reproducibility.

---

## 🌀 Plotting Strategy

- Loop through each kit:
  - Plot **alpha diversity** metrics across replicates.
  - Subset to **experimental samples** for **beta diversity** plots.
- Use `ggplot2` or `phyloseq` visualization tools.
- Compare:
  - **Within-kit** replicate similarity
  - **Across-kit** differences
